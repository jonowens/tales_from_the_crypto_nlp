## General Information

There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so we want to take stock, so to speak, of the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.  The following project allows us to gain a hands-on approach to natural language processing and sentiment in the news focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while understanding other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words, phrases, organizations, and entities mentioned in news articles.[1]
